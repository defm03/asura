# Asura
## Script for dynamic arch install

**Asura** (Sanskrit: असुर) preside over moral and social phenomena.
Bhargava believes that, in most of the ancient hymns, the word, asura,
is always used as an adjective meaning "powerful" or "mighty". In the 
Rigveda, two generous kings, as well as some priests, have been 
described as asuras. One hymn requests a son who is an asura. In nine 
hymns, Indra is described as asura. Five times, he is said to possess 
asurya, and once he is said to possess asuratva. Agni has total of 12 
asura descriptions, Varuna has 10, Mitra has eight, and Rudra has six. 
Bhargava gives a count of the word usage for every Vedic deity. Among 
the asuras are Varuna, the guardian of Rta, and Aryaman, the patron of 
marriages.

In later texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas, the devas are 
the good beings, and the asuras are the bad ones. According to the 
Bhagavad Gita (16.6), all beings in the universe assume either the 
divine qualities (daivi sampad) or the material qualities (asuri 
sampad). The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita describes the 
divine qualities briefly and the materialistic qualities at length. In 
summary, the Gita (16.4) says that the asuric qualities are pride, 
arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance.

In Buddhist cosmology: **Asura** (Tib: lha ma yin; Jpn: 阿修羅 Ashura) –
The world of the Asuras is the space at the foot of Mount Sumeru, much
of which is a deep ocean. It is not the Asuras' original home, but 
the place they found themselves after they were hurled, drunken, from 
Trāyastriṃśa where they had formerly lived. The Asuras are always 
fighting to regain their lost kingdom on the top of Mount Sumeru, but 
are unable to break the guard of the Four Great Kings. The Asuras are 
divided into many groups, and have no single ruler, but among their 
leaders are Vemacitrin (Pāli: Vepacitti) and Rāhu.
